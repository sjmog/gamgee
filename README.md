# Gamgee

A Chrome browser extension that transcribes audio from your browser tab and microphone using Deepgram's Speech Recognition API. The extension appears as a sidebar on the right side of your browser window.

## Setup

### Development Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) from your address bar
3. Turn on developer mode in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked", and select the `src` directory

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to files in the `src` directory
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Find the "Gamgee" extension card
4. Click the circular refresh/reload icon (ðŸ”„) on the extension card
5. Your changes will now be available in the extension

Note: You'll need to reload the extension (step 4) whenever you make changes to the code. If you're modifying the sidebar or options pages, you'll also need to close and reopen them to see your changes.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the sidebar
2. Enter a [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys) in the options page
3. On the tab you want to transcribe audio from, click "Start transcription" and select the tab - you must share both tab audio and microphone access for this extension to work
4. The transcript will appear in the sidebar in real-time as audio is transcribed

## Code Structure

### `manifest.json`
The manifest file is required for Chrome extensions. The provided `permissions` allow for storage (of transcripts and your API Key), access to tab data, the ability to execute our transcription script, and the sidebar functionality. The `host_permissions` allow for this extension to run on any URL - you can change it if you want to limit its usage to only specific websites.

### `sidebar.html` and `sidebar.js`
The sidebar is the main interface that appears on the right side of the browser window when the extension icon is clicked. On load, it fetches the latest transcript from storage, if there is one.

When the start button is clicked, the sidebar gets the current tab, and executes `content-script.js`.

When the stop button is clicked, a message is sent to `content-script.js` with the message 'stop'.

When the clear button is clicked, the currently-stored `transcript` value is removed.

When the options button is clicked, the extension's `options.html` file is opened.

When the sidebar receives a message with the value 'transcriptavailable', it gets the latest complete transcript from storage and adds it to the display.

### `options.html` and `options.js`
The options pane gets and displays the existing Deepgram API key from storage, if it exists. It can also be used to save a new key.

### `content-script.js`
This script is executed when the user clicks the start button in the sidebar.

The script retrieves the Deepgram API Key from storage (set in the options pane), and asks the user to select a tab to share. If audio is not shared as part of this, the script will not continue.

The script also requests microphone access, and both the tab audio and microphone input are mixed into a single audio source for transcription.

The transcription then takes place every 250ms using Deepgram's Speech Recognition API, and as transcripts are returned, they are saved into storage, and a `transcriptavailable` message is sent to the sidebar, prompting it to update the displayed value.

When the stop message is sent from the sidebar, the transcription session is closed.
